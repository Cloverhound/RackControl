# HOW TO USE

Requirements - Ruby 2.53, postgresql , familiar with running a rails application (there are tons of blogs online)

1.) Open the webpage (http://localhost:3000) and you will appear at the LabRack screen. Most of you will only need one rack, however here at Cloverhound we have a Wireless and Collaboration rack.

2.) Add a rack with a name.

3.) Add your VMWare devices first. The platform works by reverting machines to a snapshot, so you'll want to go into your VMWare and make snapshots of all the starting points for your labs. For example on a CUCM it may be pretty much a clean install of a cluster with not much configuration.

4.) Add all your devices, this is your Cisco hardware devices and your VMWare devices. (You will see under a Device, you can select a VMWare Device instead)

5.) Add your lab scenarios. You can have as many as you like. A lab scenario ties devices to specific configs for that lab.  This way you can have different starting points for your labs.

6.) Add your devices to a Lab.

7.) Add configurations to those devices under a lab (This is also where you associate the Snapshot name you want)

You will find 'revert' buttons near each device in the lab and for the lab as a whole.

Enjoy this gift from you friends at Cloverhound future CCIEs.
